He's my fav character from bsd so ofc I'm going to be thinking about him pissing himself lmao

*He usually doesn't use the restroom unless he really needs it. Sometimes when he's at home he's just too lazy to get up and will wet himself wherever he's at and sit in it for a bit

*He whimpers like crazy when he gets desperate. He'll likely be tearing up and biting his lip, his hands jammed between his legs as he rocks back and forth trying to keep it in. He's like a sad little puppy🥺

*Loves begging his partner to use the bathroom

*He usually is so in control, so for him it's really relieving to just give it up for a little bit. He loves getting so desperate that he can't even think, and the helplessness of just letting go and wetting himself is very satisfying and relaxing.

*Wasn't really into diapers at first but occasionally he's worn them just so he didn't have to get up to go pee lol

*He also really enjoys watching other people get desperate. He can be quite cruel and sadistic, denying his partner bathroom privileges and not relenting no matter how desperate they get.
