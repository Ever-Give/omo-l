Ages ago when I first got into omo back in the early 2000s I recall reading a fanfic featuring an 18-year old girl named Alice desperate on her way to school(due to her drinking eight glasses of orange juice) on the bus, for some reason I never finished that story back then so I don't know what happens after that. If anyone knows what story i'm talking about and could point me to it that'd be really swell.
