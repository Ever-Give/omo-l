It's been a little while since I posted one of these and there's been some changes but here's what you need to know: I love writing omorashi, I have nearly no limits, and have started sending custom invoices(unless you'd rather avail googlepay) via my online store's payment processing which means that even if you don't have PayPal if you'd like a custom story from me you're able to avail my services anywhere in the world.

I have (usually) a turn around time of 24/48 hours and the only exception to this is if I'm being commissioned for an ongoing novel-length series. I work on stories in the order I recieve commision requests and love doing it, no series is off limit and no subject is to macabre.

If you're interested and like a commission dm me on here and we'll discuss it.
