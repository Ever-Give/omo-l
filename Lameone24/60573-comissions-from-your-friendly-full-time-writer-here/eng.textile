Hey everyone it's that time of the month again.

As you may or may not not know writing is my full time job.

If you'd like a comission please inbox me and I'm happy to write something for you expediently and affordably.

I'm able to write basically any series you're interested in and have a typical turn around time of between a few hours and two days .

I try to make my rates affordable for anyone that would like a story.

Typically I charge 15$ for the first 1000 words and then 1$ for every hundred words after, if you'd like multiple stories I'm amenable to negotiation especially if you're on a budget.

If any of this sounds like you send me a message.

If you can't due to being new here but would like one feel free to comment on my thread.

Your humble writer,

Lameone24.
