Hi everyone! I'm currently working on writing a novel, but decided I needed a break to just write some short, fun scenes. All characters are original to me. I'm looking to improve my writing so any feedback you have would be greatly appreciated!! I hope you enjoy 🙂

Training Needs

I’d been trying to ignore the growing pressure in my bladder for the better part of an hour as we trained, but unfortunately, it didn’t seem to be getting any better. The rare 30 degree day we were experiencing meant that I’d been drinking much more water than typical during training today, and all those physical exercises certainly weren’t helping. My bladder had finally reached the point where I could hardly stand still when I raised my hand.

“Lyra, can I take a five minute break?” I asked my girlfriend, who just so happened to also be the strongest one in this camp, a pureblood vampire, and the one training us today.

“Alex, you know the policy on breaks. If this were a real battle, would Victor be letting you take a break? No, he wouldn’t,” she said as she turned to face the others. “We learn to fight through discomfort here because in battle, lost concentration means almost certain death.”

She turned back to me with a sympathetic look in her eyes, but rules are rules, and I guess I shouldn’t have expected her to make an exception for me. I turned back to my training partner, Jesse, and peeled off my now sweat soaked shirt. A quick peek down told me that my bladder was starting to distant past my normally lean muscled stomach and I groaned internally, hoping that training would end soon.

I took up a fighting stance across from Jesse, ready to resume our hand-to-hand combat. Unfortunately for me, Jesse was our camp's only telekinetic, meaning I had to move fast if I wanted to outmaneuver him.

I felt his power reaching out a second before it grabbed me and flung myself to the side, dodging it. With a powerful kick, I sprung off the dirt in a lunge, shifting my claws out as I flew. His power hit me when I was only inches from him, flinging me to the side. I landed in a crouch position, dust rising behind me. My bladder barked in protest as I clenched everything to stop from leaking while jumping over another band of telekinetic power.

I didn’t feel the second band of power until it grabbed me, tossing me across the ring where I landed in the dirt. The force of the landing forced a tiny leak out of me and I doubled down, twisting my legs until I was sure I could stand.

Then, without warning, I rose and used my werewolf speed to my advantage as I ran in a zigzag pattern at Jesse, dodging every band of power he threw at me. I leaped, tackling him the the ground facedown, pinning him. My legs were almost trembling with the effort of holding back the veritable ocean swelling within me by this point as I waited for him to tap out. After a few long seconds of struggling and his power feebly attempting to rip me off, I heard the three taps in the dirt and got up, trying to subtly cross my legs.

“That was a good fight,” said Jesse as I helped him up, wincing slightly at the strain that put on my overtired bladder. “Are you okay? I didn’t hurt you, did I?” Jesse asked innocently, seemingly unaware of my current plight.

“Yeah, I’m okay. I just have to piss like a racehorse right now,” I admitted, crossing my legs again.

“Shit dude, hopefully training ends soon. No offense to your girlfriend or anything, but she’s pretty intense about this stuff.”

Luckily, the last pair finished sparring at just that moment and Lyra called out for the end of practice. Eager to empty the flood inside me, I turned away immediately, heading to the nearest tree.

“Alex!” I heard Lyra calling from behind me and reluctantly turned around again to face her, growing more desperate by the second.

“Lyra, can we talk after? I gotta go now,” I tried to emphasize my current predicament.

“Alex, I’m sorry, Paul just asked if we would speak to him in his office. Can you wait until after that?”

I weighed the heaviness in my lower abdomen, considering if I would actually be able to wait that long. After a few second deliberation, I decided I probably could and nodded my head, following her across camp.

“How bad is it?” She asked quietly.

“Very,” I answered through clenched teeth, “I’ve had to go for way over an hour now.”

“I’m sorry I couldn’t let you go earlier, I can’t go making exceptions just because we’re together.”

“I know, I understand,” I replied as we reached Paul’s cabin and opened the door. The fidgeting would have to wait as I stepped into the safehouse leader’s cabin and through to his office.

Paul was a wolf-witch hybrid and had been leading the camp for years. His cabin was a log structure with an entry, office, med room, and bedroom, and was by far the largest cabin in the camp. It was decorated with dark wood furniture and felt as though it was an extension to the forest itself, with all the plants inside.

He gestured to the two seats in front of his desk and I gladly took a seat, crossing my legs over each other.

“Trainign went well today?” He asked Lyra as she settled herself into the chair beside mine.

“Yeah,” she responded with a smile, “everyone’s coming along really nicely.”

“Good, good. I asked you both here today because, unfortunately, with all the injuries we’ve had to heal in training, we’ve run out of your venom, Lyra,” he finished.

“You need me to donate more?” She asked.

“Are you able to right now? I know you need to be in a specific state for it to work,” he asked.

“Yeah,” she responded slowly, “I haven’t fed in a few days so with Alex here it should be no problem. Alex, are you able to stay for this?”

This is not how I wanted this to go. It was supposed to be a quick meeting and then I could go empty my aching bladder, but this sometimes took up to an hour, depending on Lyra’s state. Despite my predicament, I found myself nodding my head. Paul had let us into this safehouse months ago with no reason to trust us, the least I could do was help with this.

Paul clapped his hands and rose from his seat, gesturing for us to follow him to the med room. The med room was small and full of an eclectic assortment of supplies ranging from modern medicine like Advil and IVs to tinctures and powders of various plants. I took a seat at the far end of the med room, crossing my legs again.

Lyra sat at the collection table, allowing her wrists to be strapped down for my safety. The collection table consisted of a bench for her to sit on, with two armrests where she was strapped in. There was a small arm that came down that hosted a rubber bite guard, which sat over the two collection vials, one for each of her upper fangs.

With one last check, Paul left the room, finally freeing me to openly fidget. By this time, my bladder was aching and occasionally spasming.

“Lyra, I hate to ask this,” I started embarrassedly, “but do you think you could try to do this fast? I really really gotta go.”

“I’ll try,” she responded, closing her eyes. I watched her take a deep inhale and within a few seconds, her fangs were pressing against her upper lip, with the tips protruding out. She opened her eyes again and the irises were blood red, her pupils blown wide. I watched as her eyes slowly shifted over my squirming form until they finally locked onto my neck.

“Tilt your head back,” she commanded, voice low with predatory intent.

I obeyed without question, which earned a slight hiss from her and she took in my exposed throat. Fast as a snake, she bit down on the bite guard and venom began flowing into the collection vials. The steady drip made my overfilled bladder scream and my hand flew to my crotch without me thinking about it. I could feel that the organ was rock solid and had distended almost to my navel, each drip from Lyra’s venom causing a new wave of urgency to course through me.

“Lyra, faster please,” I begged. She closed her eyes again, breathing deeper and deeper as the venom started to flow faster.

I wasn’t sure I was going to make it anymore. I was almost positive I had never had to piss so bad in my life. It took everything in me to stop from leaking as the dripping continued into the vials.

“Can I make it go faster?” I choked out.

She took her fangs from the bite guards. “Alex,” she paused, eyes rolling back, “you smell so fucking good I can barely stay sane right now. There’s one way to make it go faster.” Another pause. “You have to cut yourself.”

At that point, I was willing to do anything to get out of that room sooner so without a pause, I shifted one finger into a claw and raked it down my forearm, letting the blood run down before pattering softly on the ground.

This seemed to be her undoing as her eyes rolled back into her head as she inhaled shakily, before exhaling with a predatory growl.

“Lyra,” I started, “remember why you’re here. The venom.”

She seemed to just barely hear me through the bloodlust and bit down again, growling when it wasn’t warm flesh her fangs were penetrating. The venom was now a constant drip from her, like the pee was about to be from her.

A particularly bad wave of desperation hit me at the moment and I groaned out loud, doubling down on my crotch to stop from leaking. Despite my best efforts, a small spurt forced its way free, dampening the front of my underwear.

“Shit, shit, shit,” I swore, fighting for my life to get it under control again. The collection vials were over half full, but I wasn’t even sure I could last another five minutes at this rate.

The next few minutes were excruciating, I was fanning my legs, bouncing my foot, and grabbing myself forcefully to keep it together. Finally, finally, the collection vials were full and I called Paul back into the room, unable to hide my need any longer.

“Are you okay?” Paul asked, alarmed at my seemingly disheveled state.

“No,” I admitted, “I have to piss really badly right now.”

“You should’ve gone before we started!” Paul exclaimed. “Let me get Lyra sorted then you can go, can you wait that long?”

“I- I think so, but please go fast.”

With that, Paul turned and grabbed a blood bag from the fridge, earning a snarl from Lyra as she sighted it. He placed it in front of her and she tore into it with her fangs, gulping down the red liquid. The sight of her drinking earned a new wave of urgency and I groaned involuntarily, clinging to sanity with all my might.

After what felt like an eternity, Lyra finished drinking and had finally calmed down. Paul gave me a nod and, still grabbing myself, I stood and hobbled past Lyra and out the front door. I had just made it a few steps out the front door when my bladder decided to give out. I pulled my already peeing dick from my pants and ran the last few steps behind the building and let loose against a tree.

I braced a forearm against the tree and leaned my head against it, revelling in the feeling of my slowly emptying bladder.

“Are you okay?” Lyra’s voice scared me and I briefly cut off the flow, before my muscles failed me again and it resumed full force, hitting the tree and splattering to the ground.

“That was way too close,” I admitted. She said nothing else and the sound of the ocean of piss inside me was the only sound. It kept going for two minutes until it finally started to slow down.

“Are you don-” Her question was cut off by another strong jet of piss splashing against the tree as I sighed contentedly. After another minute, I felt like my bladder was finally empty and I turned to face her, utterly spent.
