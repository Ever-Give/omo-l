I can write a story for you, so please comment if you’d like a story from me. To be accepted, you must meet the criteria:

- Be kind about how you say what you want. I’d expect this from all of you though.

- Tell me what tags to add, etc.

- Names, characters, and appearances, and setting! All these matter very much.

- Tell me if it’s too NSFW / inappropriate for some. I can put warnings.

- Tell me if you need me to add a Trigger Warning. Just in case.

- I am not going to swear in any of my stories. Words like ‘sexy’ and ‘hot’ and ‘attractive’ are fine.
