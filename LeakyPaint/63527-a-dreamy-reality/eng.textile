As she was running down the street, feeling the wind on her face, each step getting harder and harder not to wet herself.

She gets to the bathroom a moment of relief come over her, just to be shattered in a instance as she realised it was locked “No, no, not like this!!” She cried out, then she was awake in her bed. It must of been a dream, but felt so real.. she thought to herself. After she had fully woken up, she checked the time. It was 6:30, then a wave of desperation come over her realising she needed to go badly, but decided to hold it longer.

54 minutes later she was desperate, nearly squeezing herself just to hold it in, she was at her limit and didn’t have long, she decided just to release the wave in her pyjamas, a rush of pee came out which soak her pink pajamas, which felt really nice, and up her back, it felt so good the feeling of the warm pee running up her back and puddling at her waste was oddly relaxing she thought to herself. She peed for a good minute until it came to the end and decided to keep the wet pajamas on for later fun, she wished it would never end but like all good thing it never lasts forever.
