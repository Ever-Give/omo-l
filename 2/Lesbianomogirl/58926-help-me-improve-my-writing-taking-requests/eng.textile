Hi! So i'm pretty new to writing and well the easiest way to get good at something is to write more. So I'm open to taking a couple (1-2) of requests. They will be one off short stories ( I work full time), I refuse to write about anyone under 18 and I much prefer writing LGBT fiction

Any requests?
