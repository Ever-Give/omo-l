I'm trying to thank of a character name for a new fic I'm planning on starting. So far thinking Bri (short for Briana). The story is going to be one of those flung across space and time ones. So I'd kinda like something that reflects that and possibly hints at a higher destiny while still being something that wouldn't stand out on present day earth. The character identifys as female but is a bit of tom boy.

Are you thinking of just a first name or did you want a surname as well? I quite like the name Bri (I'm also really into tomboys, so this sounds great). I can't wait to read more about your fic!

I just posted the first paragraph of "Through the Storm" if you want to read it. :)

Aphrodite .... the name of a Greek goddess, hence your implication of "higher things". Always shortens it to "Aphro" ... and people think it's a nickname referring to her affro hairstyle ... perhaps make her mixed race so the hairstyle suits: African-American father, Greek mother ...

I actually ended up going with Bri but it's a good suggestion. Honestly though as a white person I'm not sure I'm comfortable writing for a biracial character in the sense that's it's not something I feel like I could ever have the experience to understand that and write the character with authenticity.
